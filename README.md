# Gmail Cleaner

The problem: you do somehow archived unwanted mails instead of deletion and now wish to find them

This tool on behalf with your credentials loads all your messages and group them by subject and sender so you can easily find them

Nothing being stored and after you are done you can just disconnect (aka revoke token)
